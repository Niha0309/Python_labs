# Introduction
This repository documents my Python learning progress through a series of lessons and exercises. Each lesson introduces new programming concepts and practices, helping to build a solid foundation in Python. The lessons cover basic syntax, data structures, functions, error handling, object-oriented programming, and more.

## Lessons Overview

### Lesson 1 - Printing Text and Symbols
Learned how to print text using both double and single quotes. Also practiced using basic math operations to print special symbols.

### Lesson 2 - Variables and Reassignment
Discovered that if the same variable name is used twice, the second assignment overwrites the first.

### Lesson 3 - Taking User Input
Learned how to take input from the user and combine two inputs for output.

### Lesson 4 - Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion
Solved a problem by creating a program to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

### Lesson 5 - Typing Mistakes and Substring Printing
Practiced fixing typos in code and learned how to print specific parts of a sentence (substring).

### Lesson 6 - Using Variables in Sentences
Learned how to print a sentence by combining variables and strings.

### Lesson 7 - String Replacement
Used the `replace()` function to replace parts of a string.

### Lesson 8 - Basic Math Operations
Practiced adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and calculating the factorial of numbers.

### Lesson 9 - Math Functions
Learned how to use functions like rounding numbers, finding the floor and ceiling, and calculating absolute values.

### Lesson 11 - Logical Operators
Practiced using logical operators to make decisions in code.

### Lesson 12 - Comparison Operators
Learned how to compare values using comparison operators such as `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`.

### Lesson 13 - `while` Loop
Used the `while` loop to repeat actions until a specific condition is met.

### Lesson 14 - `for` Loop
Practiced the `for` loop to repeat tasks a fixed number of times.

### Lesson 15 - Nested Loops
Learned how to use loops inside other loops (nested loops).

### Lesson 16 - Lists
Learned about lists and how to store and manage multiple values within them.

### Lesson 17 - 2D Lists
Worked with two-dimensional lists (lists of lists) and learned how to access values within them.

### Lesson 18 - List Methods
Explored various list methods such as appending, inserting, and removing elements from lists.

### Lesson 19 - Finding Unique List Items
Learned how to extract unique items from a list.

### Lesson 20 - Tuples
Studied tuples, which are like lists but immutable (cannot be changed).

### Lesson 21 - Unpacking Tuples
Learned how to unpack tuples and assign their values to variables.

### Lesson 22 - Dictionaries
Studied dictionaries, which store data in key-value pairs.

### Lesson 23 - Text to Emojis
Created a program that converts specific text into emojis.

### Lesson 24 - Simple Functions
Learned how to create and use simple functions to make code reusable.

### Lesson 25 - Functions Returning Values
Practiced creating functions that return values after execution.

### Lesson 26 - Writing Reusable Functions
Learned how to write clean, reusable functions to make the code more organized and efficient.

### Lesson 27 - Error Handling in Functions
Studied how to handle errors in functions using `try`, `except`, and other error-handling techniques.

### Lesson 28 - Commenting Code
Learned how to use comments effectively to explain what the code does.

### Lesson 29 - Classes and Objects
Introduced to object-oriented programming, learned how to create classes and instantiate objects.

### Lesson 30 - Constructors in Classes
Studied constructors (`__init__` method) and how they initialize objects within a class.

### Lesson 31 - Inheritance
Learned about inheritance, where one class can inherit properties and methods from another class.

### Lesson 32 - Importing Modules
Practiced importing external modules into Python programs.
